anta karanas:
manas,

indriha,

citta , like an ocean, which is fluid in nature, if you drop something in it gets into a ripple
	if the water is calm, you can see the bottom of the ocean (citta)

yoga	is a method, which teaches you , what is citta, how come the vrittis arise, how to stopp the vrittis
	when the pyche is stabile and clear , you can see your true original nature on the bottom of citta

5 possible states of citta:

mura	totally confused, so much attached to to things of the world, wealth power and fame,gold and lust, no subtle ideas, ignorance and stupidity
ksipta	scattered mind, no concentration is possible, no patience, no willing
viksipa	swinging between understanding and not understanding, practising and not practising
ekagrata one pointed concentration, concentrated on nobles ideas of life, not moving away from those noble ideas, holding on to these ideas over a period of time
samadhi	no ripples, no swinging, disassociate you of all this game, the reality within you blossoms

citta	my inner being takes on different forms, depending of the ripples happeing in my citta

sutra	aphorism, short few words put together, taught by word of mouth (no printing available)
spiritual life	from master to master, paramparam

sutra 2 yogah citta vritt nirodha
yoga	method, how to find out your true original nature, distinguish between your cultural nature (what you think you are) and true original nature
	identify with your cultural nature (what you think you are) you get entangled with the world, victim of circumstances
	identify with your true original nature, you are not getting entangled with the world , you watch the world without likes or dislikes, just see how it is
	method to analyze the vrittis created within me

citta	unique indian concept, cognition, volition, emotion, will . these 4 are an expression of human psychy
	the mind stuff, the stuff with whih your mind is made off
	a modulated form of citta is your mind
	huge amount of water (consciousness - cosmic fluid ) , water is tasteless, colourless, can take any shape, any color
	citta , personal manifestation of consciouness (prakruti)

prakruti	infinite, without end, without beginning, it is one, permates everything in this world
	chitta, is that fraction of prakruti within me,

	chitta is one in each one of us

vritti	the human psyche, a whirlpool, waves in water, a particular wave is a manifestion of the human psyche
	seeing:  eyes - mind - brain center (vision center, emotion center, taste center, touch center)
	stimulate the water to form ripples

5 senses are 5 pebbles , thrown into citta, forming vrittis

consiousness

manas	mind, mindful, bring the mind to your senses, mind jumps around like an monkey
	is a form of mana, in the form of a vritti

bhutti	determinative faculty, this is this

ahamkar	i see this, it is me seeing the flower

awareness	when you are aware you make an experience

indi
	
cognition
volition
emotion
will
	knowledge is the base, to handle these 4 expressions of psychy
	power flows out of knowledge, once you know it you can manage it
	you become the ruler and are not anymore ruled by the circumstances

vritt
	
cognition	bhutti + ahamkar + manas = i am seeing this book
mind	is an aspect of chitta

chitta	is a storehouse of all my 5 senseses gathered

chitta	is in constant vritti happening

chitta my psyche, my beeing, 

	vritti of anger, vritti of sadness i have totally identified
	i am identifying with my vrittis, i am victing of not knowing your true original nature

	identifying with vrittis is compulsive behaviour

	conscious behaviour is created by identifying with your true original nature

yoga	how to stop this vritti creation (nirodha)
	yoga citta vritti nirodha

sense organs -> manas -> vrittis
	ideas, concepts, experiences , all of them are vrittis of different colours, 
	the whole game of experience, from the grossest to the subtles is in the domain of vrittis

identify each and every action within you, each vritti has to be controlled

restles	jumping like a grashopper without any goal, no analysis, no penetrating thinking

ksipta	almost like made, can not hold to anything which is subtle, not patience or will or undestanding for subtle things

mura	low attidude to life, not humain like, no discriminative capacity, no patience


viksipta shifting, some discriminative capacity, some sense in it, swinging between dark (rage, anger) and light (understanding, analysis), swinging between compulsion and conscious

ekagrata	one pointed concentrated mind, one goal, one idea, one object which satisfies you enormally, you enjoy this subject constantly, for example an artist, a musiscian
		wants to paint these abstract ideas on the canvas, in the process he has forgotten time, space and the world and also forgotten himself

ekagra chitta	cultivate your chitta to produce only that vritti which you want, treat your chitta like a spoiled child, having patience, not using violence, by and by 

samadhi chitta

6 schools of phylosophy:

vedanta		brahman, from the cosmic view, beyond time and space, eternal
		maya, is the cause of mystery, cause of all misconception

Shamkya		purusha (enumerable in every beeing, pure consciousness, pure existence, pure bliss) , 
		
		prakruti (is one) the cause of all material transformation, consists of tamas, rajas, sadttva, in infinite 
		not beliefing in existence of god

yoga		beliefing in god (ishwara)

consciousness is like water, it is formless, can take shape of any container
your chitta	takes the color of the impressions you daily feed it with		

Disk 5: 1 - 15

vritti svarupiam iteratra
my true original is : chit svarup, anand svarupa, sat svarup
svarupata	identity, envolvement
emotions	are modulations of my mind, it is not me, i am experiencing a emotion: i am the experiencer, in the process of experiencing, the emotion is the object of experiencing

Basis of an experience: 1) i am experiencing (ahamkar, ego)
			2) i am experiecing ( the mind is here, aware of the object of expierience
			3) the object of expirience, i am identifying with the object of experience (I am sad, i am joyful, i am hungry)


Being and Becoming is a natural law.

You become on what you concentrate!

When there is the natural tendency of the mind to get envolved with the object of concentration, then you better choose an object of concentration which is similair to your true original nature.

Time is conceived in terms of change. If you do not conceive change, you concentrate on one object over a long period of time, you will not conceive time. 90 minutes are over in a blink of an eye.

Sadhana:
Make a proper choice of concentration of object on which your vrittis will develop!!
