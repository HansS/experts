patanjali yoga sutras - vedanta sydney - swamiSridharananda

1
atha yoga anushasanam,
now is the beginning of the teachinng of yoga, the eternal wisdom
is given to you by Patanjali's words

2
yogah citta vritti nirodha
yoga is the art to stop the creation of vrittis in the citta, stop the vegaries of the mind
prevent the vrittis occuring in your citta
citta: looley can be compared to my beeing

3
tadah drashtu svarupa avastanam, 
when you have succeded in stopping the vrittis at that time
the experiencer is dwelling in his own true nature.

4
vritti svarupa iteratra 
if not succeded, vrittis are constantly created in citta, throw away your limitations
go beyond physical limitaations, break down physical boundaries, (mind reading, ...), extra sensory. 

1 samadhi pada, Concentration
2 sadhana pada, unceasing humain effort to reach that particular goal
3 extraordinary qualities, extra sensory, extra physical
4 kaivelva pada , achieved that goal in life

27' start with first sutra, with detailed explanation

indrias		sense organs, brain centers
anta karana, 	inner instruments (karana: instrument)

anta karanas:
manas, 	
bhuddi		role: this is this
indriha,
ankara		role: me , i have seen it

5
senses		eyes,ears, nose, tongue, skin


citta , like an ocean, which is fluid in nature, if you drop something in it gets into a ripple
	if the water is calm, you can see the bottom of the ocean (citta)

yoga	is a method, which teaches you , what is citta, how come the vrittis arise, how to stopp the vrittis
	when the pyche is stabile and clear , you can see your true original nature on the bottom of citta

5 possible states of citta:

mura	totally confused, so much attached to to things of the world, wealth power and fame,gold and lust, no subtle ideas, ignorance and stupidity
ksipta	scattered mind, no concentration is possible, no patience, no willing
viksipa	swinging between understanding and not understanding, practising and not practising
ekagrata one pointed concentration, concentrated on nobles ideas of life, not moving away from those noble ideas, holding on to these ideas over a period of time
samadhi	no ripples, no swinging, disassociate you of all this game, the reality within you blossoms

citta	my inner being takes on different forms, depending of the ripples happeing in my citta

sutra	aphorism, short few words put together, taught by word of mouth (no printing available)
spiritual life	from master to master, paramparam

sutra 2 yogah citta vritt nirodha
yoga	method, how to find out your true original nature, distinguish between your cultural nature (what you think you are) and true original nature
	identify with your cultural nature (what you think you are) you get entangled with the world, victim of circumstances
	identify with your true original nature, you are not getting entangled with the world , you watch the world without likes or dislikes, just see how it is
	method to analyze the vrittis created within me

citta	unique indian concept, cognition, volition, emotion, will . these 4 are an expression of human psychy
	the mind stuff, the stuff with whih your mind is made off
	a modulated form of citta is your mind
	huge amount of water (consciousness - cosmic fluid ) , water is tasteless, colourless, can take any shape, any color
	citta , personal manifestation of consciouness (prakruti)

prakruti	infinite, without end, without beginning, it is one, permates everything in this world
	chitta, is that fraction of prakruti within me,

	chitta is one in each one of us

vritti	the human psyche, a whirlpool, waves in water, a particular wave is a manifestion of the human psyche
	seeing:  eyes - mind - brain center (vision center, emotion center, taste center, touch center)
	stimulate the water to form ripples

5 senses are 5 pebbles , thrown into citta, forming vrittis

consiousness

manas	mind, mindful, bring the mind to your senses, mind jumps around like an monkey
	is a form of mana, in the form of a vritti

bhutti	determinative faculty, this is this

ahamkar	i see this, it is me seeing the flower

awareness	when you are aware you make an experience

indi
	
cognition
volition
emotion
will
	knowledge is the base, to handle these 4 expressions of psychy
	power flows out of knowledge, once you know it you can manage it
	you become the ruler and are not anymore ruled by the circumstances

vritt
	
cognition	bhutti + ahamkar + manas = i am seeing this book
mind	is an aspect of chitta

chitta	is a storehouse of all my 5 senseses gathered

chitta	is in constant vritti happening

chitta my psyche, my beeing, 

	vritti of anger, vritti of sadness i have totally identified
	i am identifying with my vrittis, i am victing of not knowing your true original nature

	identifying with vrittis is compulsive behaviour

	conscious behaviour is created by identifying with your true original nature

yoga	how to stop this vritti creation (nirodha)
	yoga citta vritti nirodha

sense organs -> manas -> vrittis
	ideas, concepts, experiences , all of them are vrittis of different colours, 
	the whole game of experience, from the grossest to the subtles is in the domain of vrittis

identify each and every action within you, each vritti has to be controlled

restles	jumping like a grashopper without any goal, no analysis, no penetrating thinking

ksipta	almost like made, can not hold to anything which is subtle, not patience or will or undestanding for subtle things

mura	low attidude to life, not humain like, no discriminative capacity, no patience


viksipta shifting, some discriminative capacity, some sense in it, swinging between dark (rage, anger) and light (understanding, analysis), 
swinging between compulsion and conscious

ekagrata	one pointed concentrated mind, one goal, one idea, one object which satisfies you enormally, you enjoy this subject constantly, 
for example an artist, a musiscian
		wants to paint these abstract ideas on the canvas, in the process he has forgotten time, space and the world and also forgotten himself

ekagra chitta	cultivate your chitta to produce only that vritti which you want, treat your chitta like a spoiled child, having patience, 
not using violence, by and by 

samadhi chitta

6 schools of phylosophy:

vedanta		brahman, from the cosmic view, beyond time and space, eternal
		maya, is the cause of mystery, cause of all misconception

Shamkya		purusha (enumerable in every beeing, pure consciousness, pure existence, pure bliss) , 
		
		prakruti (is one) the cause of all material transformation, consists of tamas, rajas, sadttva, in infinite 
		not beliefing in existence of god

yoga		beliefing in god (ishwara)

consciousness is like water, it is formless, can take shape of any container
your chitta	takes the color of the impressions you daily feed it with		

Disk 5: 1 - 15
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vritti svarupiam iteratra
my true original is : chit svarup, anand svarupa, sat svarup
svarupata	identity, envolvement
emotions	are modulations of my mind, it is not me, i am experiencing a emotion: i am the experiencer, in the process of experiencing, 
the emotion is the object of experiencing

Basis of an experience: 1) i am experiencing (ahamkar, ego)
			2) i am experiecing ( the mind is here, aware of the object of expierience
			3) the object of expirience, i am identifying with the object of experience (I am sad, i am joyful, i am hungry)


Being and Becoming is a natural law.

You become on what you concentrate!

When there is the natural tendency of the mind to get envolved with the object of concentration, 
then you better choose an object of concentration which is similair to your true original nature.

Time is conceived in terms of change. If you do not conceive change, you concentrate on one object over a long period of time, 
you will not conceive time. 90 minutes are over in a blink of an eye.

Sadhana:
Make a proper choice of concentration of object on which your vrittis will develop!!
You become what you consume with your mind!!!
choose proper objects of concentration!

Disk 5: 35 - 60
Learn to disasociate with your vrittis
do not let you take possession of your vrittis
always identify with your true original nature: freedom, liberation, Sat Chit Ananada

our general tendency is to enjoy to the world with our outward oriented senses

What do i achive with persueing objects of the world. I do not achieve lasting values. After a time i loosse the joy of the objects

Be yourself, do not running for outward objects, identifying with the modulation of the mind (hunger , thirst, misery, lust...)

My spontaneous nature is outward going, getting entangled with the world

Go back to your original nature

Use your eyes with intelligence, recognize the objects of what they are, so the objects loose attraction for your

I see the form and see the reality behind the form.

What ever you saw so you earn! Law of cause and effect, causality

Let me subject to that law - manage your present to create your future -> so you are the creator of your destiniy

Handle your present moment with care and wisdom, it will be your future!

When the identification is happening, so choose vrittis which are helpful for you to manifest your true original nature (SatChitAnanada -> Vedanta)

Goal of Life

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cause of bondage can be  used to be the cause for mukti!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
be eager to learn, fresh ideas, how to live a life, art of living, deep dive to know what it is, you must learn what is happeing within you -> 
all the time identification
god is always with you, doing everything in the presence of god
ishwara pranidhana, dedicate yourselef to god, change your life


Disk 6 - Understand your lifestyle

sadhana	spiritual discipline
sadhuka	spiritual aspirant

Tada Drashtu Svarupe Avastanam - well established in his true original nature, at that time with my effort and guidance of guru and grace of devine i achieved the goal
	at that time purusha reveils, no more identified with the vrittis, free from bondage, no more a victim of anything, you are what you are

vedanta	braham is the ultimate reality, the ultimate goal, jiva avidia, maya: brahman is one , the many are a manifestation of brahman
yoga	Purusha, the eternal, ever consciouses, uninvolved, ever pure, it is enumerable, everyone has a purusha, Prakruti is one, without beginninng without end, is active
	made out of thre gunas raja, sattva, tamas

Goal of life: realize my true original nature

5 states of mind of man - classify the vrittis

tama
ksipta
viksipta
ekagrata
nirodha

Choose your vrittis by your will power - such vrittis which support ekagrata or nirodha

What type of vritti is good for me, i hold to it and identified with it:  i am noble and nobility establish in my chitta

Disk 6 25' Pys 5: Vrittaya pancha

2 Types: clishta (painful) and aclishta (not painful)

clishta		painful vritts; klesha caraka
aclishta	not painfull vrittis

There are 5 different categories of vrittis: 

1 avidya	suffer from lack of proper understanding of my true original nature, still identifying with the vrittis, 
the missing understanding leads to suffering
		i am not aware of my pure consciousness

2 asmitha	ego, vanity, pride

3 raga		attachment to things of the world

4 dwesha	aversion, i hate it

5 anidiadwesha	by force of habit (attachment to something), because of your dwesha, you are doing something also 
your consciousness says do not do it!!

viveka bhuddi 	consciousness,

aklishta vritti - not painful
cultivate these vrittis which will not cause pain. Raja Yoga - Psychic Control, Holding onto your goal, creating not painful vrittis
During that period, 
samskara	clishta samskara, aclishta samskara, vrittis leave behind impressions in your mind -> samskara
introspective way of living: being aware of the modulations of the mind

Disk 7 1' - 30'
Sri Rama Krishna - Spiritual Principles
concretiztes these wisdom in his life
identify harmful vrittis
identify non harmful vrittis to use them to eraticate the harmful vrittis
replace harmful vrittis with no harmful vrittis

as of today we are filled with harmful (clishta) vrittis

5 categories vrittis:
pramana	vritti	method of knowing which leads to rock solid conviction, to reach your goal of life (samadhi), to know the thing in itself, without any color
		the cristall has no colour, it takes the red color of the rose behind the crystal, like we are mistaking ourself with the maya

viparyaya vrti	it appears to be, before it is proved to be wrong, what this is not i think it is to be, mistake a snake for a rope, l
ack of proper understanding, lost the ability to clear discrimination
		i take a snake for a rope and get in fear, not being able to see the thing as it is, my perceiption is not clear
		misconeption, forgetten myself, taken maya for the real thing, illiusion, phantasy, not clear perception, mistaking a thing

vikalpa	vritti	i utter a word, you make an image from the word,stop running for things before analyze them and then take the decision

nidra vritti	sleep, dreamless sleep, i am so deep asleep, the experiene of the world has vanished (sushupti), the world has covered up

smriti	vritti	memory, i have met you (the impression on me when i saw you the first time), impressions in the mind stuff

be careful to what vrittis are allowed to crop up in your mind!

each and every experience is vritti, classified in 5 categories£: positive: pramana, smriti, nidra, negative:vikalpa, viparyaya

Sutra 7: positive chitta vritti are of 3 types:
